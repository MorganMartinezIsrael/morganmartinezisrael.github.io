            <p>With a heart of furious fancies,
                    Whereof I am commander,
                    With a burning spear and a horse of air,
                    To the wilderness I wander.
                    (Tom O'Bedlam's Song).</p>

            <p>BY late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high state of philosophical
                    excitement. Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely
                    unexpected ... so entirely novel ... so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions ...
                    as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics
                    in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears. </p>
            
            <p>It appears that on the ... day of ..., (I am not positive about the date,) a vast crowd
                    of people, for purposes not specifically mentioned, were assembled in the great square of
                    the Exchange in the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was warm --- unusually
                    so for the season --- there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and the multitude were in no
                    bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary
                    duration, that fell from large white masses of cloud profusely distributed about the blue
                    vault of the firmament. Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation
                    became apparent in the assembly; the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded; and,
                    in an instant afterwards, ten thousand faces were upturned towards the heavens, ten
                    thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a
                    shout, which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long,
                    loudly and furiously, through all the city and through all the environs of Rotterdam. </p>

            <p>The origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From behind the huge bulk
                    of one of those sharply defined masses of cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to
                    emerge into an open area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid
                    substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner
                    comprehended, and never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who
                    stood open-mouthed below. What could it be? In the name of all the devils in Rotterdam,
                    what could it possibly portend? No one knew; no one could imagine; no one --- not even
                    the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk --- had the slightest clew by which to
                    unravel the mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man
                    replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and maintaining an eye steadily
                    upon the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly --- then
                    waddled back, grunted, paused, and finally --- puffed again. </p>
            
            <p>In the meantime, however, lower and still lower towards the goodly city, came the
                    object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke. In a very few minutes it
                    arrived near enough to be accurately discerned. It appeared to be --- yes! it was
                    undoubtedly a species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in
                    Rotterdam before. For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of 
                    dirty newspapers? No man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the
                    people, or rather at some distance above their noses, was the identical thing in question,
                    and composed, I have it on the best authority, of the precise material which no one had
                    ever before known to be used for a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the good
                    sense of the burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even still
                    more reprehensible, being little or nothing better than a huge fool's-cap turned upside
                    down. And this similitude was regarded as by no means lessened, when upon nearer
                    inspection, the crowd saw a large tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper
                    rim or base of the cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept
                    up a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse. Suspended by blue
                    ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine, there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab
                    beaver hat, with a brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band
                    and a silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens of Rotterdam
                    swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly
                    seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Pfaall, upon sight of
                    it, uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her
                    good man himself. Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Pfaall, with
                    three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about five years before, in a
                    very sudden and unaccountable manner, and up to the date of this narrative all attempts at
                    obtaining intelligence concerning them had failed. To be sure, some bones which were
                    thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately
                    discovered in a retired situation to the east of the city; and some people went so far as to
                    imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in
                    all probability Hans Pfaall and his associates. But to return. </p>

            <p>The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within a hundred feet of
                    the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently distinct view of the person of its
                    occupant. This was in truth a very singular somebody. He could not have been more than
                    two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient to destroy
                    his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention of a
                    circular rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon. The
                    body of the little man was more than proportionally broad, giving to his entire figure a
                    rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen at all. His hands were
                    enormously large. His hair was gray, and collected into a queue behind. His nose was
                    prodigiously long, crooked and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin
                    and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and double; but of ears of any
                    kind there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd
                    little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight breeches to
                    match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees. His vest was of some bright yellow
                    material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and, to complete his
                    equipment, a blood-red silk handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty
                    manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions. </p>

            <p>Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the surface of the
                    earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared
                    disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma. Throwing out, therefore, a
                    quantity of sand from a canvass bag, which he lifted with great difficulty, he became
                    stationary in an instant. He then proceeded in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract
                    from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book. This he poised
                    suspiciously in his hand; then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise, and was evidently
                    astonished at its weight. He at length opened it, and, drawing therefrom a huge letter
                    sealed with red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely at the feet
                    of the burgomaster Superbus Von Underduk. His Excellency stooped to take it up. But
                    the ;aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no further business to
                    detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make busy preparations for departure;
                    and, it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the half
                    dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without taking the trouble to empty
                    their contents, tumbled, every one of them, most unfortunately, upon the back of the
                    burgomaster, and rolled him over and over no less than half a dozen times, in the face of
                    every individual in Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed, however, that the great Underduk
                    suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity. It is
                    said, on the contrary, that during each of his half dozen circumvolutions, he omitted no
                    less than half a dozen distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which he held fast the
                    whole time with all his might, and to which he intends holding fast, (God willing,) until
                    the day of his decease. </p>

            <p>In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away above the city, at
                    length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged,
                    and was thus lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citizens of Rotterdam. All
                    attention was now directed to the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences
                    attending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity
                    to his Excellency, Von Underduk. That functionary, however, had not failed, during his
                    circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important object of securing
                    the epistle, which was seen, upon inspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands,
                    being actually addressed to himself and Professor Rubadub, in their official capacities of
                    President and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of Astronomy. It was accordingly
                    opened by those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the following
                    extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communication: </p>

            <p>To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rubadub, President and Vice-President of the
                    States' College of Astronomers, in the city of Rotterdam.</p>

            <p>Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by name Hans
                    Pfaall, and by occupation a mender of bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from
                    Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered
                    unaccountable. If, however, it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this
                    communication, am the identical Hans Pfaall himself. It is well known to most of my
                    fellow-citizens, that for the period of forty years I continued to occupy the little square
                    brick building, at the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time of 
                    my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind --- they, as
                    well as myself, steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of
                    mending of bellows: for, to speak the truth, until of late years, that the heads of all the
                    people have been set agog with politics, no better business than my own could an honest
                    citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good, employment was never
                    wanting, and there was no lack of either money or good will. But, as I was saying, we
                    soon began to feel the effects of liberty, and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that
                    sort of thing. People who were formerly the very best customers in the world, had now
                    not a moment of time to think of us at all. They had as much as they could do to read
                    about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age. If
                    a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper; and as the
                    government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in
                    proportion --- for, in a very short time, there was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam
                    that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state
                    of things not to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and children
                    to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in
                    reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life. Duns, in the
                    meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation. My house was literally besieged from
                    morning till night. There were three fellows in particular, who worried me beyond
                    endurance, keeping watch continually about my door, and threatening me with the law.
                    Upon these three I vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as to get
                    them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this
                    anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by
                    blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to dissemble my
                    wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of fate,
                    an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me. </p>

            <p>One day, having given them the slip, and feeling more than usually dejected, I continued
                    for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object, until at length I
                    chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller's stall. Seeing a chair close at hand,
                    for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why,
                    opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach. It proved to be a small
                    pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin,
                    or by a Frenchman of somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of information on
                    matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the
                    book --- reading it actually through twice before I awoke to a recollection of what was
                    passing around me. By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward
                    home. But the treatise (in conjunction with a discovery in pneumatics, lately
                    communicated to me as an important secret, by a cousin from Nantz) had made an
                    indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved
                    carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the
                    writer. There were some particular passages which affected my imagination in an
                    extraordinary manner. The longer I meditated upon these, the more intense grew the
                    interest which had been excited within me. The limited nature of my education in general, 
                    and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far
                    from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or
                    inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely
                    served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable
                    enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all
                    the appearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality, and other
                    inherent properties of instinct or intuition. </p>

            <p>It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed. My mind, however,
                    was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night buried in meditation. Arising
                    early in the morning, I repaired eagerly to the bookseller's stall, and laid out what little
                    ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical
                    Astronomy. Having arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to
                    their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I thought
                    sufficient for the execution of a certain design with which either the devil or my better
                    genius had inspired me. In the intervals of this period, I made every endeavor to
                    conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally
                    succeeded --- partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of
                    their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a little
                    project which I told them I had in view, and for assistance in which I solicited their
                    services. By these means (for they were ignorant men) I found little difficulty in gaining
                    them over to my purpose. </p>

            <p>Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife, and with the greatest
                    secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small
                    sums, under various pretences, and without giving any attention (I am ashamed to say) to
                    my future means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money. With the
                    means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in
                    pieces of twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep
                    basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary in the
                    construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions. This I directed my
                    wife to make up as soon as possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the
                    particular method of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the twine into net-work of
                    sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords; and made purchase
                    of numerous instruments and materials for experiment in the upper regions of the upper
                    atmosphere. I then took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation east of
                    Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a larger
                    size; six tin tubes, three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in length; a
                    quantity of a particular metallic substance, or semi-metal which I shall not name, and a
                    dozen demijohns of a very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter materials
                    is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself --- or at least never applied
                    to any similar purpose. I can only venture to say here, that it is a constituent of azote, so
                    long considered irreducible, and that its density is about 37.4 times less than that of
                    hydrogen. It is tasteless, but not odorless; burns, when pure, with a greenish flame, and is
                    instantaneously fatal to animal life. Its full secret I would make no difficulty in
                    disclosing, but that it of right belongs (as I have before hinted) to a citizen of Nantz, in 
                    France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself. The same individual
                    submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a method of constructing
                    balloons from the membrane of a certain animal, through which substance any escape of
                    gas was nearly an impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was
                    not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of gum caoutchouc, was
                    not equally as good. I mention this circumstance, because I think it probable that
                    hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas
                    and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very
                    singular invention. </p>

            <p>On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during
                    the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a small hole; the holes forming in this manner
                    a circle twenty-five feet in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being the station designed
                    for the large cask, I also dug a hole of greater depth. In each of the five smaller holes, I
                    deposited a canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg holding one
                    hundred and fifty pounds of cannon powder. These --- the keg and the canisters --- I
                    connected in a proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters
                    the end of about four feet of slow-match, I covered up the hole, and placed the cask over
                    it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond
                    the cask. I then filled up the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their
                    destined situation! </p>

            <p>Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the d√©p√¥t, and there secreted, one of
                    M. Grimm's improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air. I
                    found this machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted
                    to the purposes to which I intended making it applicable. But, with severe labor and
                    unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success in all my preparations. My
                    balloon was soon completed. It would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas;
                    would take me up easily, I calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly,
                    with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain. It had received
                    three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk
                    itself, being quite as strong and a good deal less expensive. </p>

            <p>Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in relation to
                    all my actions from the day of my first visit to the bookseller's stall; and promising, on
                    my part, to return as soon as circumstances would permit, I gave her what little money I
                    had left, and bade her farewell. Indeed I had no fear on her account. She was what people
                    call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world without my assistance. I
                    believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle body --- a mere makeweight
                    --- good for nothing but building castles in the air --- and was rather glad to get rid
                    of me. It was a dark night when I bade her good bye, and taking with me, as aides-decamp,
                    the three creditors who had given me so much trouble, we carried the balloon, with
                    the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout way, to the station where the other articles 
                    were deposited. We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to
                    business. </p>

            <p>It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was dark; there was not a star to be
                    seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable. But my
                    chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was
                    defended, began to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable to
                    damage. I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence, pounding down ice
                    around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the others. They did not cease, however,
                    importuning me with questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and
                    expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo. They could not
                    perceive (so they said) what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin,
                    merely to take a part in such horrible incantations. I began to get uneasy, and worked
                    away with all my might; for I verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a
                    compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing better than
                    it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of their leaving me altogether. I contrived,
                    however, to pacify them by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could
                    bring the present business to a termination. To these speeches they gave of course their
                    own interpretation; fancying, no doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of
                    vast quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed, and a trifle more, in
                    consideration of their services, I dare say they cared very little what became of either my
                    soul or my carcass. </p>

            <p>In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently inflated. I attached the
                    car, therefore, and put all my implements in it --- a telescope; a barometer, with some
                    important modifications; a thermometer; an electrometer; a compass; a magnetic needle;
                    a seconds watch; a bell; a speaking trumpet, etc., etc., etc. --- also a globe of glass,
                    exhausted of air, and carefully closed with a stopper --- not forgetting the condensing
                    apparatus, some unslacked lime, a stick of sealing wax, a copious supply of water, and a
                    large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in
                    comparatively little bulk. I also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat. </p>

            <p>It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it high time to take my departure. Dropping
                    a lighted cigar on the ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to pick
                    it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, the end of which, as I said before,
                    protruded a little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks. This manoeuvre was
                    totally unperceived on the part of the three duns; and, jumping into the car, I immediately
                    cut the single cord which held me to the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot
                    upwards with inconceivable rapidity, carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five
                    pounds of leaden ballast, and able to have carried up as many more. As I left the earth,
                    the barometer stood at thirty inches, and the centigrade thermometer at 19. </p>

            <p>Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards, when, roaring and rumbling
                    up after me in the most tumultuous and terrible manner, came so dense a hurricane of
                    fire, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, and mangled limbs, that my very
                    heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car, trembling with terror. 
                     </p>

            <p>Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the business, and that the main
                    consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a
                    second, I felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and, immediately
                    thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly through the night, and
                    seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. When I afterwards had time for reflection, I
                    did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its
                    proper cause --- my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest power. But at
                    the time, I thought only of preserving my life. The balloon at first collapsed, then
                    furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with sickening velocity, and finally,
                    reeling and staggering like a drunken man, hurled me over the rim of the car, and left me
                    dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my face outward, by a piece
                    of slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near
                    the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most
                    providentially entangled. It is impossible --- utterly impossible --- to form any adequate
                    idea of the horror of my situation. I gasped convulsively for breath --- a shudder
                    resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle in my frame --- I felt my
                    eyes starting from their sockets --- a horrible nausea overwhelmed me --- and at length I
                    lost all consciousness in a swoon.</p>

            <p>How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It must, however, have been no
                    inconsiderable time, for when I partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day
                    breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace of
                    land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon. My sensations,
                    however, upon thus recovering, were by no means so replete with agony as might have
                    been anticipated. Indeed, there was much of madness in the calm survey which I began to
                    take of my situation. I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and
                    wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins, and the
                    horrible blackness of the finger nails. I afterwards carefully examined my head, shaking it
                    repeatedly, and feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that
                    it was not, as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon. Then, in a knowing
                    manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a
                    tooth-pick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance, and, not being able to do
                    so, felt inexpressibly chagrined. It now occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in
                    the joint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer
                    through my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither astonished nor horror-stricken. If I
                    felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was
                    about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma; and never, for a moment, did I
                    look upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt. For a few minutes I
                    remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation. I have a distinct recollection of
                    frequently compressing my lips, putting my fore-finger to the side of my nose, and
                    making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their
                    arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance. Having, as I thought,
                    sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution and deliberation, put my hands
                    behind my back, and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the waist-band 
                    of my pantaloons. This buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with
                    great difficulty on their axis. I brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles
                    to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that position. Holding
                    within my teeth the instrument thus obtained, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my
                    cravat. I had to rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre; but it was at
                    length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made fast the buckle, and the other
                    end I tied, for greater security, tightly around my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards,
                    with a prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in
                    throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the circular
                    rim of the wicker-work.</p>
